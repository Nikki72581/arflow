# Archived Documentation

This directory contains legacy documentation that is no longer current but kept for historical reference.

## Contents

### STEP Files (Commission System)
These files were from when the project was being developed as "CommissionFlow" - a commission tracking system. The project has since evolved into ARFlow - an Accounts Receivable portal.

- `STEP-*.md` - Development step documentation from the commission system phase

### Legacy Deployment Files
- `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Old deployment guide (consolidated into [../guides/deployment.md](../guides/deployment.md))
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Old checklist (merged into deployment guide)

### User Testing Files
- `USER_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Testing guide for old commission system
- `USER_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` - Checklist for testing commission features

### Other
- `TESTING-SUMMARY.md` - Testing summary (superseded by [../guides/testing.md](../guides/testing.md))

## Why These Are Archived

These documents:
- Reference a different product (CommissionFlow vs ARFlow)
- Use outdated file structures and naming
- Contain instructions that no longer apply to the current system
- Have been consolidated into the new documentation structure
